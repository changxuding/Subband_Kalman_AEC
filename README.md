# Subband_Kalman_AEC
Subband kalman filter for echo cancellation, include residual echo suppression as speex.

## To be optimized
- dual filter for better control 
- dtd for different residual echo supression between st and dt
- matrix calculation efficiency of m file

## Problem to be concerned
- bad performance of high frequency in some cases
